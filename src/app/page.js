      <p>I'm a Assistant Professor and an aspiring Software Dev. Teaching holds a special place in my heart, but my true passion lies in coding, crafting technical articles and an ardent reader, a wordsmith in the making. My dream is to fill my days with the joy of coding, tackling real-life challenges via code and sharing my knowledge through written insights.  </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>My interests span across Software Development, Web2, Web3, Full-Stack Development, and my eclectic hobbies include exploring International Relations, indulging in culinary delights and expressing myself through the art of painting.</p>
